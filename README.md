# Hotel Bookings Cancellation Analysis

Welcome to my Hotel Bookings Cancellation Analysis project! This repository contains insights and analysis into hotel bookings cancellations, exploring various factors such as hotel type, country, customer type, and monthly trends.

## Insights

### Hotel Type Analysis

- The **City Hotel** shows a notably higher total number of reservations compared to the **Resort Hotel**. However, the cancellation rate at the City Hotel is also significantly higher than at the Resort Hotel.

### Country Analysis

- **Portugal (PRT)** stands out with the highest number of total reservations and cancellations, indicating a substantial volume of bookings and cancellations compared to other countries.
- Countries like **Brazil (BRA)**, **Spain (ESP)**, **France (FRA)**, and the **United Kingdom (GBR)** also exhibit a considerable number of reservations and cancellations.
- Some countries, such as the **Netherlands (NLD)** and the **USA (USA)**, have relatively lower total reservations but still experience a significant number of cancellations.

### Customer Type Analysis

- **Couples** represent the largest segment of guests based on total reservations, but they also account for a significant portion of cancellations.
- **Families** and **single guests** also contribute to the total reservations, with relatively lower cancellation rates compared to couples.

### Monthly Analysis

- The summer months, particularly **July** and **August**, witness the highest total reservations, indicating peak travel seasons. However, these months also experience higher cancellation rates, suggesting potential challenges in managing bookings during peak seasons.
- **November** and **December** have comparatively lower total reservations but also exhibit lower cancellation rates, possibly due to being off-peak travel periods.
